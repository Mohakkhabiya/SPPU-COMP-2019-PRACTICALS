# SPPU-COMP-2019-PRACTICALS
This repository contains all the practical assignments which I have done as part of my coursework.
The GitHub repositories for SPPU practicals provide a comprehensive collection of practical assignments and projects tailored to the Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) curriculum. These repositories are organized by subjects and include detailed README files that outline the purpose, structure, and implementation of each practical. For instance, one repository focuses on Laboratory Practice III for Computer Engineering, covering topics like algorithms, machine learning, and blockchain technology. Another repository includes practical codes for System Programming and Operating Systems (SPOS) and Internet of Things (IoT), featuring Python implementations and Arduino-based projects. These resources are invaluable for students seeking hands-on experience and a deeper understanding of their coursework.
Let me know if you'd like help exploring these further!
